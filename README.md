# About me
<b> I am a type of person that isn't satisfied until my work is completely and perfectly done.</b> I always had an interest in computers and the magic called programming that tells the computer what to do. My passion for programming started when I was young, seeing all of the possibilities you can do with it. Game development was a starting point for me, I learned how to use Unity game engine and how to program in C#, I created a lot of finished games and even more unfinished ones where I learned from my mistakes. I would like to see other people's creations to get inspiration and to potentially learn something new. Currently I am interested in exploring how the web works, that means learning JavaScript in depth. Switching to JavaScript wasn't that hard I picked up very quickly and I am ready for the next step.
